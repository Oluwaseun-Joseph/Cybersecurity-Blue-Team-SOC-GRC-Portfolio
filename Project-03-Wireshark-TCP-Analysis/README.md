# Project 03 – Wireshark TCP Analysis: File Upload, Segmentation & RTT Measurement

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes how the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** ensures reliable data delivery
by capturing and inspecting a real file upload using **Wireshark**.

A ~150 KB text file (*Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*) was uploaded from a client machine to the
remote server **gaia.cs.umass.edu**, and the full packet exchange was captured and analyzed.
The investigation focuses on:

- TCP three-way handshake
- Sequence and acknowledgment numbers
- TCP segmentation
- Receiver-advertised window (flow control)
- Round-trip time (RTT) measurement
- Retransmission verification

This project demonstrates **packet-level network analysis skills** relevant to SOC, Blue Team,
and Network Security roles.

## 🔬 Investigation Walkthrough

### Step 1: Downloading the File

The ASCII version of *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland* was downloaded from the UMass Wireshark lab site.

📸 **Figure 2 – Saving `alice.txt` locally**  
📁 Screenshot file: `alice-save-dialog.png`

---

### Step 2: Navigating to the Upload Page

The TCP upload page was accessed to prepare for uploading the file.

### Step 3: Selecting the File

The previously downloaded `alice.txt` file was selected using the Browse button.

### Step 4: Starting Packet Capture

Wireshark packet capture was started before initiating the upload.

### Step 5: Uploading the File

The file upload was initiated and confirmed as successful.

## 🔎 Packet Analysis

### HTTP POST Inspection & Segmentation

The captured trace was inspected to locate the HTTP POST request responsible for uploading
`alice.txt`.

📸 **Figure 7 – Expanded HTTP POST request**  
📁 Screenshot file: `http-post-expanded.png`

The POST payload exceeded a single TCP segment and was therefore segmented.

### TCP Handshake Observation

A TCP display filter was applied to isolate handshake packets.
