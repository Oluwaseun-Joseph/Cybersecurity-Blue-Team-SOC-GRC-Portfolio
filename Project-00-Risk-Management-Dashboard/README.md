 Project 00 – Risk Management Dashboard

## Overview
This project delivers a **risk management dashboard** designed to support structured risk identification, prioritization, and decision-making. The dashboard consolidates risk data into a clear visual format that enables stakeholders to quickly assess risk exposure, severity distribution, and areas requiring mitigation or escalation.

The project emphasizes how risk information is translated into actionable insights for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) environments.
