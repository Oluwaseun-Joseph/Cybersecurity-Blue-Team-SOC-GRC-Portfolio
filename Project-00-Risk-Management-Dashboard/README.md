# Project 00 – Risk Management Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a **risk management and visualization project** centered on
an Excel-based dashboard designed to support risk identification, prioritization, and
decision-making.

The dashboard aggregates risk data and presents it in a structured, visual format to
help stakeholders quickly understand risk exposure, severity distribution, and areas
requiring mitigation or escalation.

This project reflects real-world **GRC and risk analyst workflows**, where dashboards are
often delivered as primary artifacts without accompanying screenshots or formal PDF
reports.

---

## Objectives
- Visualize organizational risk exposure in a single dashboard
- Support risk-based decision-making using severity and impact indicators
- Demonstrate understanding of risk scoring and prioritization
- Align dashboard logic with common risk management practices

---

## Primary Artifact
The core deliverable for this project is the Excel dashboard located in:

Files/Risk-Analysis-Dashboard.xlsx

In many risk and GRC roles, Excel dashboards serve as the **final operational deliverable**
used by analysts, managers, and auditors.

## Risk Methodology (Summary)
Risk scoring follows a qualitative-to-semi-quantitative approach based on:
