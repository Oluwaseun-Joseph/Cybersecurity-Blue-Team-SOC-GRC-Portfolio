# Risk Register Structure

## Purpose
This document presents a representative risk register structure that complements the Risk Management Dashboard. I use this format to document, track, and assign ownership for identified risks within a formal governance process.

## Risk Register Format

|--------|------------------|------------|--------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| R-001 | Unauthorized access to sensitive data | High | High | High | Implement MFA and access reviews | IT Security |
| R-002 | Outdated system patches | Medium | High | Medium | Patch management program | IT Operations |

## Governance Notes
- I use risk IDs to support traceability and reporting  
- Assigned risk owners ensure accountability  
- Mitigation strategies document planned risk treatment actions  
- The dashboard provides a summarized view of this information for management review and discussion
