# Risk Methodology

## Purpose
This document describes the risk evaluation methodology I used to support the Risk Management Dashboard. My objective was to apply a structured, repeatable approach that aligns with common enterprise risk management practices while remaining flexible across different organizational contexts.

---

## Risk Evaluation Approach
I evaluate risks using two primary dimensions: likelihood and impact. This approach supports consistent prioritization and clear communication of risk posture.

### Likelihood
Likelihood represents the probability that a risk event may occur within the assessed environment. I apply a qualitative scale:

- Low  
- Medium  
- High  

Likelihood assessments are informed by contextual factors such as historical trends, control maturity, and operating conditions.

---

### Impact
Impact represents the potential severity of consequences if a risk materializes. When assessing impact, I consider factors such as:

- Financial loss  
- Operational disruption  
- Regulatory or compliance exposure  
- Reputational impact  

---

## Risk Rating Determination
I derive overall risk ratings by combining likelihood and impact values. This enables clear differentiation between risks that require immediate attention and those suitable for routine monitoring.

---

## Dashboard Integration
The dashboard applies calculated risk ratings to:
- Highlight risks requiring management attention  
- Support prioritization and escalation discussions  
- Enable consistent reporting across stakeholders  

---

## Framework Alignment
The methodology I applied aligns conceptually with widely adopted risk management standards, including:

- NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessment)  
- ISO/IEC 27005 (Information Security Risk Management)  
- COSO Enterprise Risk Management principles  

This approach is designed to be adaptable and scalable across different organizational environments.
