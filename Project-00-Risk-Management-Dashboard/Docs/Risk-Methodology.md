# Risk Methodology

## Purpose
This document outlines the risk evaluation methodology used to support the Risk Management Dashboard. The methodology is designed to ensure consistency, transparency, and alignment with common enterprise risk management practices.

---

## Risk Evaluation Approach
Risks are evaluated using two primary dimensions:

### Likelihood
Likelihood represents the probability that a risk event will occur within the defined context. Ratings are applied using a qualitative scale:

- Low  
- Medium  
- High  

Likelihood assessments consider historical trends, control effectiveness, and environmental factors.

---

### Impact
Impact represents the potential severity of consequences should a risk materialize. Impact considerations may include:

- Financial loss  
- Operational disruption  
- Regulatory or compliance exposure  
- Reputational impact  

---

## Risk Rating Determination
Overall risk ratings are derived by combining likelihood and impact values to support prioritization and decision-making. This approach enables clear differentiation between high-priority risks and those requiring routine monitoring.

---

## Dashboard Integration
The dashboard leverages calculated risk ratings to:
- Highlight risks requiring management attention  
- Support prioritization and escalation discussions  
- Enable consistent risk reporting across stakeholders  

---

## Framework Alignment
This methodology aligns conceptually with widely adopted risk management standards, including:

- NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessment)  
- ISO/IEC 27005 (Information Security Risk Management)  
- COSO Enterprise Risk Management principles  

The methodology is adaptable and can be tailored to different organizational risk contexts.
