# Risk Methodology

## Purpose
This document describes the risk evaluation methodology used to support the
Risk Management Dashboard.

The goal is to provide transparency into how risk scores are derived and how
risks are categorized for prioritization.

---

## Risk Scoring Approach
Risk is evaluated using two primary dimensions:

### 1. Likelihood
Represents the probability that a risk event will occur.

Typical qualitative scale:
- Low
- Medium
- High

---

### 2. Impact
Represents the potential severity of the risk if it occurs.

Impact may include:
- Financial impact
- Operational disruption
- Compliance or regulatory exposure
- Reputational damage

---

## Overall Risk Rating
Overall risk levels are derived by combining likelihood and impact values.

A common interpretation:
- Low likelihood + Low impact → Low risk
- High likelihood + High impact → High risk
- Mixed combinations → Medium risk

---

## Dashboard Usage
The dashboard is designed to:
- Highlight high-risk items requiring attention
- Support prioritization discussions
- Enable management review and escalation decisions

---

## Framework Alignment
The methodology aligns conceptually with:
- NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessment)
- ISO/IEC 27005 (Information Security Risk Management)
- COSO Enterprise Risk Management principles
