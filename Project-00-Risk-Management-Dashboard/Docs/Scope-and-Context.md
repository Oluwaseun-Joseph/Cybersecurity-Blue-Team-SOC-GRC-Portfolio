# Scope and Context

## Scope Definition
This project focuses on risk visualization and prioritization to support governance and management decision-making. I designed the dashboard to present risk posture clearly and consistently within a defined assessment scope.

---

## Operating Context
- I apply predefined risk scoring thresholds to ensure consistent evaluation  
- Risk data represents a structured assessment snapshot  
- The dashboard supports review, discussion, and prioritization activities rather than automated decision-making  

---

## Intended Use
I designed this dashboard as a decision-support tool for risk, compliance, and governance stakeholders. It enables structured discussion of risk exposure and supports alignment between technical teams and management.

The design emphasizes clarity, repeatability, and adaptability across different organizational environments.
